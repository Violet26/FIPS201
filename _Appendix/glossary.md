# Appendix Câ€” Glossary of Terms, Acronyms, and Notations {#s-c}

This informative appendix describes the vocabulary and textual representations used in the document.

## C.1 Glossary of Terms {#s-c-1}

The following terms are used throughout this Standard.

Access Control
: The process of granting or denying specific requests: 1) obtain and use information and
related information processing services; and 2) enter specific physical facilities (e.g., federal buildings,
military establishments, border crossing entrances).

Applicant
: An individual applying for a PIV Card/credential. The applicant may be a current or
prospective federal hire, a federal employee, or a contractor.[^eligibility]

Application
: A hardware/software system implemented to satisfy a particular set of requirements. In
this context, an application incorporates a system used to satisfy a subset of requirements related to the
verification or identification of an end user's identity so that the end user's identifier can be used to
facilitate the end user's interaction with the system.

Architecture
: A highly structured specification of an acceptable approach within a framework for
solving a specific problem. An architecture contains descriptions of all the components of a selected,
acceptable solution while allowing certain details of specific components to be variable to satisfy related
constraints (e.g., costs, local environment, user acceptability).

Asymmetric Keys
: Two related keys, a public key and a private key, that are used to perform
complementary operations, such as encryption and decryption or signature generation and signature
verification.

: The process of establishing confidence of authenticity; in this case, in the validity of a
person's identity and the PIV Card.

Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL)
: A measure of the strength of an authentication mechanism, and therefore the confidence in it, as
defined in [[SP 800-63]](references.md#ref-SP-800-63) in terms of three levels:

  - AAL1: SOME confidence

to a captured biometric sample. [[ISO2382-37]](references.md#ref-ISO/IEC-2382-37) 

Biometric Characteristic
: Biological attribute of an individual from which 
distinctive and repeatable values can be extracted for the purpose

promulgating, and supporting FIPS for testing specific characteristics of components, products, and
services, as well as people and organizations for compliance with a FIPS.

additional attributes) to that individual.

departments and agencies that has been developed within the Information Technology Laboratory and
published by NIST, a part of the U.S. Department of Commerce. A FIPS covers some topic in
information technology to achieve a common level of quality or some level of interoperability.

Hash Function
: A function that maps a bit string of arbitrary length to a fixed length bit string. Secure
hash functions [[FIPS180]](references.md#ref-FIPS180) satisfy the following properties:

  1. **One-Way.** It is computationally infeasible to find any input that maps to any pre-specified
    output.
  2. **Collision Resistant.** It is computationally infeasible to find any two distinct inputs that map to
    the same output.

Identification
: The process of discovering the identity (i.e., origin or initial history) of a person or item
from the entire collection of similar persons or items.

Identifier
: Unique data used to represent a person's identity and associated attributes. A name or a card
number are examples of identifiers.

Identity

recognizable.

Identity Proofing
: The process of providing sufficient information (e.g., identity history, credentials,
documents) to establish an identity.

Identity Management System (IDMS)
: Identity management system comprised of one or more systems
or applications that manages the identity verification, validation, and issuance process.

Identity Registration
: The process of making a person's identity known to the PIV system, associating a
unique identifier with that identity, and collecting and recording the person's relevant attributes into the
system. In some other NIST documents such as [[SP 800-63A]](references.md#ref-SP-800-63A), identity registration is referred to as *enrollment*.

Identity Verification
: The process of confirming or denying that a claimed identity is correct by
comparing the credentials (something you know, something you have, something you are) of a person
requesting access with those previously proven and stored in the PIV Card or system and associated with
the identity being claimed.

Issuer
: The organization that is issuing the PIV Card to an applicant. Typically this is an organization
for which the applicant is working.

Issuing Facility
: A physical site or location---including all equipment, staff, and
  documentation---that is responsible for carrying out one or more of the
  following PIV functions:
  
  * identity proofing/registration;
  * card/token production;
  * activation/issuance; and
  * maintenance.

Key
: See "Cryptographic Key."

Match
: Comparison decision stating that the biometric probe(s) and the biometric 
reference are from the same source. _Match_ is a possible result of a 
_Comparison_. The opposite of a match is a _non-match_. See [[ISO2382-37]](references.md#ref-ISO/IEC-2382-37) for more details.

by the Integrated Circuit Chip (ICC) of the PIV Card.

On-Card
: Refers to data that is stored within the PIV Card or to a computation that is performed by the
Integrated Circuit Chip (ICC) of the PIV Card.

: An online protocol used to determine the status of a public
key certificate. [[RFC6960]](references.md#ref-RFC6960)

Path Validation
: The process of verifying the binding between the subject identifier and subject public
key in a certificate, based on the public key of a trust anchor, through the validation of a chain of
certificates that begins with a certificate issued by the trust anchor and ends with the target certificate.
Successful path validation provides strong evidence that the information in the target certificate is
trustworthy.

Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
: Information that can be used to distinguish or trace an
individual's identity, such as name, social security number, biometric data records, etc. alone, or when
combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual,
such as date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, etc. [[OMB1712]](references.md#ref-OMB1712)

Personal Identification Number (PIN)
: A secret that a cardholder memorizes and uses to authenticate
their identity.

Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Account
: The logical record containing credentialing information for a given PIV cardholder.  This is typically stored within the issuerâ€™s identity management system, and includes PIV enrollment data, cardholder identity attributes, and information regarding authenticators bound to the cardholderâ€™s identity (e.g., PIV card and derived PIV credentials).

Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Card
: A physical artifact (e.g., identity card, "smart" card) issued
to an individual that contains a PIV Card Application which stores identity credentials (e.g., photograph,
cryptographic keys, digitized fingerprint representation) so that the claimed identity of the cardholder can
be verified against the stored credentials by another person (human readable and verifiable) or an
automated process (computer readable and verifiable).

employee for the purpose of the employee's protection (i.e., the employee might be placed at risk if his or
her actual name were known) or for other purposes.

Public Key
: The public part of an asymmetric key pair that is typically used to verify signatures or
encrypt data.

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
: A support service to the PIV system that provides the cryptographic
keys needed to perform digital signature-based identity verification and to protect communications and
