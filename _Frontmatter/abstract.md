# ABSTRACT

Authentication of an individual’s identity is a fundamental component of physical and
logical access control. When an individual attempts to access security-sensitive 
buildings, information systems and applications, an access control decision must be made. An 
accurate determination of an individual’s identity supports making sound access control
decisions.

This document establishes a standard for a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) system that meets the control and security objectives of Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 [[HSPD-12]](_Appendix/references.md#ref-HSPD-12). It is based on secure and reliable forms of identity credentials issued by the Federal Government to its employees and contractors. These credentials are intended to authenticate individuals who require access to federally controlled facilities, information systems, and applications. This Standard addresses requirements for initial identity proofing, infrastructure to support interoperability of identity credentials, and accreditation of organizations and processes issuing PIV credentials.

The Standard describes the card elements, system interfaces, and security controls required to securely store, process,
and retrieve identity credentials from the card. The physical card characteristics, storage media, and data
elements that make up identity credentials are specified in this Standard. The requirements for issuing PIV derived credentials are specified in Special Publication 800-157, *Guidelines for Derived Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Credentials*.
The interfaces and card 
architecture for storing and retrieving identity credentials from a smart card are specified in Special
Publication 800-73, *Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification*. The interfaces and data formats of
biometric information are specified in Special Publication 800-76, *Biometric Specifications for Personal
Identity Verification*. The requirements for cryptographic algorithms are specified in Special Publication
800-78, *Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for Personal Identity Verification*. The requirements for
the accreditation of the PIV Card issuers are specified in Special Publication 800-79, *Guidelines for the
Accreditation of Personal Identity Verification Card Issuers*. The unique organizational codes for federal
agencies are assigned in Special Publication 800-87, *Codes for the Identification of Federal and
Federally-Assisted Organizations*. The requirements for card readers are specified in Special Publication
800-96, *PIV Card to Reader Interoperability Guidelines*. The format for encoding the chain-of-trust for
import and export is specified in Special Publication 800-156, *Representation of PIV Chain-of-Trust for
Import and Export*.
